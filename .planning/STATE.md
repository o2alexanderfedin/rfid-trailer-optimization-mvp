# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-18)

**Core value:** Generate route-aware, LIFO-correct trailer load plans that minimize blocked-freight rehandle and continuously repair them as conditions change — demonstrated live over a simulated USA hub network.
**Current focus:** Phase 2 — Load Planning

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 5 (Load Planning) — next
Plan: Phase 1 complete (7 plans + MEDIUM-fix); ready to plan Phase 2
Status: Phase 1 ✅ COMPLETE — verified (11/11 reqs, 0 HIGH issues), merged
Last activity: 2026-06-19 — Phase 1 executed via rival subagents in worktrees: 7 plans + adversarial review + 6 MEDIUM fixes. Gates green (build/lint, 126 tests, e2e 3/3).

Progress: [██░░░░░░░░] 20% (1 of 5 phases complete)

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Phase 1 ✅ 2026-06-19]: Operational Data Foundation + Live Map Spike COMPLETE. Delivered FND-01..08, SIM-01/02, VIZ-01. TS/Node monorepo (pnpm+Turborepo): @mm/domain (build-gated closed event union + zod), @mm/event-store (append-only + optimistic concurrency + gap-free global order), @mm/projections (pure reducers + FND-04 golden-replay keystone), @mm/simulation (10 US hubs, seeded deterministic stream), @mm/api (Fastify queries + catch-up projections + ws), @mm/web (OpenLayers+OSM live map). Built via rival subagents in worktrees + judge + adversarial review. Carried LOW debt documented in 01-REVIEW.md. M-1/M-2 readAll cursor: low-water-mark guard added now; revisit if Phase 4 optimizer becomes a concurrent writer.
- [Roadmap]: 5-phase MVP — foundation → load planning → RFID validation → rolling optimizer → sim/viz wrapper.
- [Phase 1]: Pull the simulation engine (SIM-01/02) and a thin geo-only map slice (VIZ-01) into Phase 1 — the sim is the only data source for everything, and the early map slice de-risks the OpenLayers centerpiece before the optimizer lands.
- [Phase 2]: Load planner is the "if all else fails" deliverable; independent LIFO validator + naive baseline (LOAD-09) designed in here, sharing KPI plumbing for the eventual before/after "money slide."
- [Phase 4]: Custom min-cost flow + VRPTW in TS (no maintained JS lib) with glpk.js held as a correctness oracle — concentrated engineering risk; flagged for /gsd-research-phase.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 4]: Open question — which JS/TS approach for min-cost flow + VRPTW (pure-TS SSP vs glpk.js LP vs OR-Tools-WASM/child-process bridge). MEDIUM confidence; gate with glpk.js correctness tests. Run /gsd-research-phase before planning.
- [Phase 5]: OpenLayers high-trailer-count rendering + smooth interpolation cadence needs a focused spike (documented leak/perf risk). Run /gsd-research-phase before planning.
